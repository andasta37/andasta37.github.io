			GIMP Image 1 - REED MEME
		</h3>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p><blockquote>
		<p>
		For my first GIMP image I decided to start with something simple to ease myself into the GIMP
		software, so I decided to make a meme. Using Professor Reed's image that I found on google, I 
		downloaded the file including a random background that I also found on google.
		<ol>
		<li>
		Opening Professor Reed's image, I used the "Lasso" tool to do a basic highlight of the area
		I am going to crop, which is his head and body.  
		</li>
		<li>
		Then, I used the "Mask Tool" to further refine my crop cut of the professor's parts by choosing 
		between the pencil and eraser tool to perfectly shade the curves of Professor Reed. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Once I am done with the shading, I can turn the masking tool off and it reveals the selected section in 
		which I have cropped. Now I go edit>copy the image and I paste it on the tab with my other image
		</li>
		<li>
		Using the move and resize tool, I adjust Professor Reed's pic to fit snuggly in the center and I used 
		the 'Text Tool' to add the text for the meme. Settings for the font and size of text is in the tab.
		</li>
		</ol>

			GIMP Image 2 - PORTRAIT FOR SAM
			
		</h3>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p><blockquote>
		<p>
		For my second GIMP image I did it on my cat, Sam. I stepped up the difficulty for this image by 
		needing to remove the time stamp on the corner of the image and blurring out the background to put
		focus on Sam himself; also I added a bit of 'make-up' on Sam, and his signature on the corner
		to replace the time-stamp.
		<ol>
		<li>
		First, I removed the time stamp. To do this I used the "Clone Tool" with a brush tip which basically allows 
		me to select an area of the image and using the color code of that area, I can use my mouse to "stamp-out"
		or color over the time-stamp to make it "disappear" but in actuality I basically just color over it to 
		match the surrounding background. This is also how I alter the facial features of Sam, I used the Clone Tool
		to get the color code of a part of his face and then colored over some facial distractions.
		</li>
		<li>
		Next is the blurred background. To do this I duplicated the layer of image on the right. Then using the 
		"Select Tool" that I learned from the first image, cropped out Sam from the background and then copy-pasta. 
		I then go and create a new layer in the layers tab and paste the cropped image on to that layer. For the the layer
		that I duplicated, that is going to be the background in which I will blur out. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Under the 'Filter' tab on the top, I selected the 'Blur' option and adjust it until the preview show me the level
		of blur that pleases me. Then, i right click on the background layer and select 'Mask layer', which basically 
		produces another layer in which you will use to shade out the layer of Sam that I cropped out. 
		</li>
		<li>
		To shade out the layer of Sam that I cropped out, I used the "Brush Tool" where I adjust the size and tip below
		and I started shading the blurred image. As I do that, the underneath layer of the cropped picture will show. 
		When I finish shading the entire portion of Sam, the unblurred, cropped picture of him should show and he
		will be surrounded by the background I blurred out.
		</li>
		<li>
		Lastly, to add Sam's signature I basically utilize the "Text Tool" from the first image.
		</li>
		</ol>
